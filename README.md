# Laravel for Platform.sh

This template provides a basic Laravel skeleton.  It comes pre-configured to use a MariaDB database and Redis for caching and sessions using a Laravel-specific bridge library that runs during Composer autoload.  The public files symlink is also replaced with a custom web path definition so it is unnecessary.  It is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs.

Laravel is an opinionated, integrated rapid-application-development framework for PHP.

## Features

* PHP 8.0
* MariaDB 10.4
* Redis 5.0
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Composer-based build

## Notice
On Platform.sh the [minimum time between cron jobs](https://docs.platform.sh/create-apps/app-reference.html#cron-job-timing) 
being triggered depends on your plan. [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/scheduling) suggests running 
the scheduler as a cron job every minute. Task scheduling may then be contradicted by the cron minimum frequency. 
Schedules outside the specified cron frequency are ignored and the related tasks arenâ€™t triggered. 

Due to this conflict, this Laravel template utilizes [workers](https://docs.platform.sh/create-apps/workers.html) to run 
both the scheduler and the queue systems. In order to have enough resources to support these workers as well as the 
MariaDB and Redis service, **this template requires at least a [Medium plan](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/pricing.html#multiple-apps-in-a-single-project).**

## Customizations

The following changes have been made relative to a plain Laravel project.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* An additional Composer library, [`platformsh/laravel-bridge`](https://github.com/platformsh/laravel-bridge), has been added.  It automatically maps Platform.sh's environment variables to Laravel's environment variables where possible.  It leverages the [`platformsh/config-reader`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php) library.
* The Laravel Bridge library also automatically configures Laravel to use Redis for both caching and session storage.  That may be disabled by removing or changing the name of the `rediscache` and `redissession` relationships in `.platform.app.yaml`.
* Laravel normally wants you to create a symlink for the public storage directory, using the `artisan storage:link` command.  That is not necessary and will not work on Platform.sh due to the read-only file system.  Instead, a dedicated web path mapping is included for the `/storage` path that has the same effect.
